# Fortran Basics 

This directory contains beginner-level Fortran programs to help me build a solid foundation in modern Fortran, with the goal of applying it in weather modeling and scientific computing.

## 📁 Folder Structure

| File Name            | Description                              |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `hello_world.f90`    | First program – prints a greeting        |
| _More coming soon..._| _(e.g., temperature converter, averages)_|

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **GFortran 13.3.0** (via WSL – Ubuntu 24.04 LTS)
- **Visual Studio Code** with:
  - Remote - WSL Extension
  - Modern Fortran Extension
- **Linux CLI (bash)**

## 🚦 How to Compile & Run

1. Open terminal in this directory:
